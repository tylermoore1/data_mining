-Project title: PUBG

-Team members: Tyler Moore, Joshua Ramos

-Description of the project: Our project focus on finding the relation between average team speed and average  
    team kills to see if it results in a higher winning percentage.

-Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers: We wanted to see if the higher number of kills a team gets
    and the farther they travel affects their chances of winning the match. After using our techniques, we found teams who averaged 3 or more kills per player had a much higher winning percentage (17%) than those who did not. Also, teams who had an average speed of 1.75 to 1.85 meters per second finished higher than those who did not.

-Application of this knowledge: After figuring these answers out, we used this new found knowledge to actually
    play. We tried to constantly keep moving and average around 3 kills per player in order to increase our chances of winning the match.
